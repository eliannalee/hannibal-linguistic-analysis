# linguistic-analysis

Hello! this repository contains linguistical analysis of three works: hannibal nbc (TV show), The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscare Wilde, and Hamlet by Shakespeare. 
These projects were my first foray into linguistical analysis via the natural language toolkit and jupyter notebook.
